## ðŸ¤– Automated Upload Script

Create this file locally as `upload_to_sheets.py`:

```python
import json
import gspread
from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials

# Configuration
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY = '''
PASTE YOUR ENTIRE JSON KEY FILE CONTENTS HERE
'''
SHEET_ID = 'YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE'
JSON_FILE = 'transcriptions_2025-08-15.json'  # Change to your file

# Connect to Google Sheets
creds = Credentials.from_service_account_info(
    json.loads(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY),
    scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets']
)

gc = gspread.authorize(creds)
sheet = gc.open_by_key(SHEET_ID)
worksheet = sheet.get_worksheet(0)

# Load your data
with open(JSON_FILE, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Clear existing data
worksheet.clear()

# Add headers with stats
stats = data['statistics']
worksheet.append_rows([
    [f"Call Transcriptions - {stats['processing_date']}"],
    [f"Total: {stats['total_recordings_found']} | Processed: {stats['total_recordings_processed']} | Success: {stats['success_rate']}"],
    [],
    ["Recording ID", "Date/Time", "Duration (min)", "From", "To", "Direction", "Transcription"]
])

# Add all transcriptions
for trans in data['transcriptions']:
    worksheet.append_row([
        trans['id'],
        trans['date'],
        round(trans['duration'] / 60, 1),
        trans['from'],
        trans['to'],
        trans['direction'],
        trans['transcription']
    ])

print(f"âœ… Uploaded! View at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{SHEET_ID}")
```

### To run:
1. Install requirements: `pip install gspread google-auth`
2. Update the configuration in the script
3. Run: `python upload_to_sheets.py`

## ðŸ“± Share Your Public Sheet

Once uploaded, your Google Sheet link can be shared with anyone:
- They can view without Google account
- They can download as Excel/PDF
- Updates automatically when you re-run the script
- Can embed in websites using iframe

Example public link:
```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID/edit?usp=sharing
```

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **For Excel**: The CSV already has statistics in the header - just share the Excel file!

2. **For Google Sheets**: Once set up, you can update the same sheet daily - it will overwrite with new data

3. **For Quick Sharing**: GitHub Gists (https://gist.github.com) also work great for CSV files

4. **Security**: Never share files with personal phone numbers publicly - consider removing/masking them first
