This is going to be like a work from home setup. So this is not an office-based opportunity. So you can actually either work part-time or full-time by working remotely or working from home. Really? That's exactly correct. Okay. Would it be possible for me to work internationally? Well, that's no problem, so long as you're actually able to attend virtual meetings. And weekly meetings, like Zoom meeting or Google Meet, that's totally fine. And I assume that you actually have the equipment to do so So I didn think that totally a problem at all Okay Yeah I definitely open to discussing different opportunities You said that it insurance? That's correct. So yeah, to give you more information, Jordan, on this company that I am partnered with, I'm not just only affiliated with one company, but with several companies within the country. Now, these companies are offering a commission-based opportunity or a 1099 commission-based opportunity with competitive compensation. This means that you can comfortably work independently, either part-time or full-time. This is, again, going to be like a work-from-home setup. Your earning potential is unlimited. On top of your commissions, there will be incentives and bonuses that you will be taking advantage of. Would that be a good fit for you? So it's 100% commission-based? It's a commission-based, yeah, it's purely 1099 commission-based opportunity, but on top of that, there will be incentives and bonuses that you will be taking advantage of, depending on the company that you will be signing. So I would suggest for you to at least give the client a chance to present you the proposal before you actually decide which company would you like to sign up with. Because on top of commissions, there will be incentives, bonuses, and benefits that you will be getting as well. Okay. I just need to ask you four questions as part of our pre-screening process. Don't worry. These four questions are all answerable by yes or no. Okay? Okay. Perfect. The first question Jordan are you open to providing your own value with a fully commission opportunity and are you okay setting a target or a goal Yes Thank you Second question I think I have already asked you this but just for the recording purposes again, you are available for a weekly meeting like Zoom meeting or Google Meet, right? Correct. Thank you. Third question, Jordan, you are fine passing a background check as well? Yes. Thank you. And the last question, are you either have a life and health insurance license? Do I or am I willing to get one? Yeah. If you do not have one, are you willing to go through a licensing process along with a company once hired? Yes. Perfect. Thank you. There we go, Jordan. Congratulations. You have completed a pre-screening interview. The next step, I will go ahead and have your information forwarded to those two clients that I am connected with. they will be reaching out to you within the day or within 24 hours. Again, they will be presenting you more information about the company's background, as well as the company's incentives, bonuses, compensation, even included, you know, the payout date. So they will also going to discuss you that. And if you also have like any other questions, please do not hesitate to ask the clients directly as you will be speaking with them directly as well. So that's the best perfect time for you to ask questions if you have anything else in mind. So, yeah, that's just really pretty much it. And I really thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. And do you happen to have, like, any questions, Jordan, before I let you go? No, no, I'm looking forward to talking with the clients. Yeah, sure. So please expect to receive a phone call from Ingrid or Stella. Those are the two clients who are actually in the insurance sales company field Now it is not too much for you as well We also have another company that in look for a different position which is a financial advisor Is that something that you would be open as well by any chance? Because I can go ahead and have your information forwarded to that third client as well. Perfect. All right. Well, I will go ahead as well and have your information forwarded to that third client, which is looking or in look for a financial advisor posting. So just please expect to at least receive three phone calls or you will be reached out by three clients within 24 hours or within the day. Again, it's much better for you to attend the phone conversation or at least give them the chance to present you the proposal for you to identify in which company or which position would you like to grab with. Because by the end of the day, it's going to be your decision. And it will really depend as well on what terms and what offer they will be going to provide you. Okay? Okay. Perfect. Jordan, I really thank you for taking the time to speak with me today, and I would like to congratulate you in advance, and I wish you nothing but the success in regards to this opportunity. Thank you so much, and enjoy the rest of your day. Okay? Goodbye for now. Thank you. Oh, Jordan, sorry. Sorry. Before I let you go, Jordan, I just really wanted to ask this question. I totally forgot. What's your, like, recent experience or work experience, by the way? oh um yeah i've i've worked um i was a park ranger uh carpenter um worked a quite a bit in hospitality as well all right i see well that's just really because i wanted to add more information here on your um data so i really appreciate that so that's just really pretty much it for me today i think you once again you have a good one and enjoy the rest of your day Okay.

Oh, how do you pronounce your last name? Empo. Empo, sorry. Oh, forgot. Thank you so much, Odette. Now, I wanted to let you know that I was reaching you out and I sent you out a text that we do have a client that matches for you. Basically, I'm from Highway Audit and I'm actually the one that screened you. Okay. Now, I wanted to ask you, since you do have a car, right? Yeah. Okay. Were you able to drive 20 to 30 minutes away from your client? You said 30 minutes? 20 to 30 minutes? 30 minutes. Are you familiar in Tumbal? Tumbal, yeah. Yes, ma'am. So the client is in there, basically. So let's just go ahead and start with the first and last name. I mean, with the client information, okay? The client... Hold on, hold on. I will try to call my husband. Papa. You can come, please. Come, I'm going to talk to people who work, the health care. Sorry, I have another language I speak. OK, that's fine, Audit. Now, I wanted to let you know that the client, the company of the client is your first care and they Cheryl McClure which is the owner of the company Now they are in Tomball which is 20 to 30 minutes away from where you live right now And they are looking... I'm sorry, go a little slowly. You say the clients, where the clients live in Tomball and the company. So it's a different company. So you're just representing that company? No, basically we... yes oh good thing that you question for no uh at least we don't have any you know confusion uh we are the middlemen okay okay yes we help our recruiters to find caregivers now we help you as well to find recruiters you know what i mean okay uh-huh now basically the company of the client is your first care under Cheryl McClure, which is the owner of the company. Now, the patients are in Tomball, Texas, and that's going to be like 20 to 30 minutes away from you. They offer 12 hours per shift. Now, I wanted to check audit if you're okay with it. Okay, so how many days a week for that 12 hours? Yeah, basically depending on that, and I would say that the client will let you know what are the days you're going to be. I'm sorry. Okay. They need somebody to work 12 hours per week or per day. Yes, 12 hours. No, 12 hours. Let me see here. Hold on. Because I take a note here. Yeah 12 hours and that going to be 12 hours in a day This is for full time Okay But that would be depending on which days Okay. Days would it be. Now, aside from that, they are looking for caregivers that have skills on dementia or Alzheimer's care, hospice or end-of-life care, mobility assistance, medication management, and that has a driver's license, and comfortable with pets, which you are, right? Now, auditors are saying they offer $14 to $17 depending on your job experiences. Aside from that, they do have benefits provided. Medical insurance, dental, vision insurance, retirement savings, and referral bonuses. Now, I wanted to ask, are you okay with this one audit so that we can set up an interview for you directly with a client? I've never worked with an assignment client before, and I'm not familiar with that. I'm afraid to say yes because I don't have experience for that one. So if it's other things, other patients, I may be considering that. But assignment, people with that sickness, I never do that before. I don't want to take a chance for something. I don't have so much experience on that. But the rest of the stuff I do have experience on that So only dementia you say Dimension yeah No I never worked with a dementia or client Okay Oh that fine Well if that's the case, how this is going to work? Do you want to, like, at least have a one-on-one interview with a client audit and see how it goes? Because basically, this is just the, you know, skills that they need, but we don't know who are the people taken care of. If they do have dementia or hospice or disabled people, we don't know yet. There's no any specification here. So they just need someone that has dementia or Alzheimer's care, which you do have the basics, right? Yes, I do have the basics, yeah. Okay. The other things I do, I can do. Okay. Got it. So here's what we are going to do. If you would like, we can set up an interview for you directly with a client. Are you okay with that audit? I'm okay. Okay. Perfect. Now, I want you to keep your lines open because our recruitment team will set up an interview for you directly. Okay? Now, I wanted to check. um all right so yeah audit uh just keep your lines open i the schedule for interview will be to to be followed because i don't have any you know availability of the client yet but we'll okay keep it posted then all right no problem okay all right anyway thank you so much have a good day and stay safe bye okay bye thank you thank you bye"

    "transcription": " I'm Gladys. Westland, can I help you? No, I'm not Gladys. I'm Tracy. Tracy, how can I help you? I'm wondering if you still have available positions for a PRN or a caregiver in your Texas area. We don't currently have an opening right now, but that changes on a daily basis, on a minute basis usually. So you can go to the website westwindhealthservices.com, and WIND is spelled W-Y-N-D-E. And up in the top right-hand corner, there's a suitcase. It says careers. There's a section that says pre-employment. if you fill that out, it'll come to my computer, and I'll have it, and I'll know to call you if I get an opening. I see. That's informative, Patricia. I know you don't have a client yet, but you're open for a caregiver. Well, I wanted to let you know that I'm on the website now. I'm Tiffany, working with Hirey. I'm not the one applying, but I'm helping caregivers land a job. I know you don't have a client yet, but you can actually avail our free program. So your first hire is totally free. Whenever you have a client, then you should be all good to go. Say, let's prepare for interview like, say, a week from now or a month from now. Whenever you have endorsement, you're good to go and there's no crunch time. So we just need to ask you for your skills, the requirements you need, and your availability to pre-screen or interview candidates. well the way the way it happens is i um i get the email and i if i have an opening i i print i print a little portion of the email and i have a book that sits there and when i have openings i start asking do you want this do you want this do you want this and that's how it usually happens i know you have been operating the business like that for quite some time but at least you You want to try this option around where you can get it free instead of you. Well, it would be great, but my boss is not going to pay for any extra services. We barely make, for attendant care services, the state is very low pay. So we probably make $2 an hour off the client as it is, and that pays for the office, the lights, the employees that do work in the office. and then it also helps pay for payroll because we use ADP. So there's not any other program that she's going to pay for. I can tell you that just because I've been there almost 20 years and she's never paid extra for anything. What a commitment working for 20 years. Exactly. You're a perfect customer for this because we have our free program right now. For the whole month of August, you can get your hire for free. if you can refer then your first hire is free and we don't normally lock in for a commitment or whatnot that's not our mission our mission is to help both my people on a job and you guys filter and find people like put them in in the list so whenever you have clients then you should be good to go you don't want to lose your client you know our our our starting pay is only 11 an hour you know what that's okay i even have a client earlier they're offering nine and ten dollars and there's a lot of tasks to do that's reasonable especially for entry level or experience or whatnot people nowadays want a job you know what i mean so um but the position uh you guys were opening for offering full and part-time roles for them or how does it work or a prn it's usually no it's usually um the hours go between 15 hours a week to 23 to 27 we have a couple that are like 40 but not many most of them are very minimum part-time um and it's it's going into a client's home bathing them feeding them um so it's like i said we don't we don't reimburse with mileage. We don't, it's very minimum. Not a whole lot of people want this job. Not a whole bunch of people can do this job because you got to have a heart to work with people. The heart and the willingness in your... Or you're not going to stay. You're not going to stay. So it's going to be private home-end people that can do ADL, like daily tasks, like, you know, helping them with daily activity, right? And you said, well, it's been to 27 hours a week. Do you happen to have weekends as well, or it's just the whole week that's the time? Weekends too? Yeah, we have some of them are seven. A lot of them are seven days a week. But if you take 21 hours and you divide it by seven, they're working three hours a day, and that's it. I see. I got you. And do you happen to have any years of experience like you guys were actually looking for right now? No, nothing in particular. I mean, no. We like experience, but no. There's willingness to work. They got to do their application online. They got to do their in-services online. They have to show up. Showing up is really important. And the patient's zip code is 77036 or no zip code yet. No, it's all over Houston. We go all the way to El Tempo. We go all the way to Galveston. We go all the way to Livingston, and we go all the way to Beaumont. Oh, gotcha. Over Houston. And regarding with interviews, are you guys doing like a walk-in? Or you said about online application, and it goes from there, right? It's online application and then me talking to them. Okay, gotcha. Because for this one, what we do with Hiree is that we let you actually do a virtual Google Meet first. that is for you to actually engage and ask the right questions And once they qualified you can let them go on site So that going to be the process And my matching team will be responsible to find the right candidates for you What I will do is I will forward all of the information to them. So the compensation you've said is $11 an hour and there's no other perks like luncheons or reimbursement and things like that. Are you guys doing a background check and drug screening as well? Yes, we are. That's perfect. And the kind of special service, are you looking for people with hospice, end of life, residential assisted living, or dementia, Alzheimer's, or residential awareness? All of the above. All of the above? No, it's wherever the state says they have an opening and they send it to us. We have kids, we have adults, we have, I mean, all ages because they're disabled. They're disabled. And ours are all Medicaid paid, so they're all monitored by the state. So they have to, that's what I said, they have to show up. They have to act proper. you know, just common sense is pretty much yeah, we're going to do a background yeah, we're going to teach you how to clock in and out but don't come to work with your pet monkey don't come to work in short short just, of course we've had people do that really? it's funny but I have had a lady take a pet monkey to work I've had a lady go and well actually because I don't go in the house every day I don't see but one of my nurses went in to do skilled nursing and she thought that the lady was holding a baby and when she got close to it she said no that's a monkey oh no like especially you're working with clients right now so do you think um you you can feel in the position like a week two weeks or three weeks from now see i can't i can't give you that that day because some of our clients come with their own workers a lot of them will hire their family members i just put no deadline it's okay we can do i haven't hired anybody i haven't hired anybody well i've hired three people this week but they came with their clients so not not new fresh out of the street i got you and the phone number for us to send you like updates for caregivers can you like give me the best phone number to receive a text 713 713-972-1902 is the office number my cell phone gets a lot of the messages my cell phone what's working now because the office is transferred to my phone the best number so my cell phone is 832 258 2114. 2114. I got you. And how do we spell your first name? T-R-A-C-Y. T-R-A-C-Y. T-R-A-C-Y. No E. Oh, Tracy. Okay. E for Tango R-A-C. And your last name, please? Garcia. G-A-R-C-I-A. I know a lot of Garcia. They're more likely like the Spanish or the Mexican side with Garcia and things like that. I married Spanish. Oh, you must be speaking bilingual. That's crazy. That's one thing I want to learn, like speaking bilingual. In your position, is an admin or part of the hiring? my position my position is supervisor, hire community liaison problem solver a lot you're wearing a lot of hats so you said 20 years that's crazy in there I've been right under the boss for 20 years that's why I'm telling you there's things that you will do And there's things she won't do. She'll tell me, no, answer that. I'm not talking to anybody. Okay. Just call commitment there. Okay. And all the phone calls come to me every night and every weekend. So, yeah. And can you help me spell the full company name and the website? Well, you don't mind. West, W-E-S-T. I see it. W-E-N-D-E. W-E-N-D-E. Okay. I got you from here. West Wind Health Services INC. I'll have your information from here. Actually, we're almost done. No zip code yet, and you said there's no time frame. And with the on-site interview, should I just go to the website and get the address from there? Or can you give me a zip code? Sure. That's the zip code for the office. It's 77036. I got you. For the patients, not yet. We're located in Charlottesville. And do you happen to have any kind of position, like you're looking for two or three people, things like that? No, we're eventually going to be looking for one more office staff. But that's 40 hours a week, bilingual, flexible because we do work holidays. We're not, you know, it's for people, those live people. You don't just get days off like everybody else does. I got you from there. It doesn't work that way. I like it. I like it. And you've said as well earlier you're okay with at least one or two years' experience. Somebody young, too young, because then they don't want to come in and they don't want to learn. I want somebody that wants to work, that wants to learn the computer, that wants to talk on the phone and talk to people and be okay with that. always the willingness you know a team player a team player that's the key word I want a team player if I don't have a team player you have no business then we're fine okay that's it right years of experience are you like kind of particular or just at least they have a willingness to want For the office job I would like experience more Okay Okay. I got you from here. But everybody, almost everybody is taking care of a family member. So it's pretty much the same thing as taking care of a family member. You're going to do for this person the same you would do for your mom if your mom was sick or your mom needed help. So experience, a lot of us have it already naturally. of course it goes along the way right it can be learned it can be yeah i got you from there yeah tracy also we're almost finished right here in regard with uh like you said uh earlier about adl right like daily tasks daily activity and are you guys doing background check and screening or both yes or no yes oh and for the certificate both uh you're accepting And then certified, CPR, HSA? Well, it depends on the client that we have available. Some clients, you must have CPR. Everybody must have a huge neglect in exploitation, but there's a free website that does that. So we tell them that upon hire. Go to this website, watch this video, take this exam. Yeah. Okay. And regarding with the required federal, aside from they should have ADL, what about driver's license? Are you also requiring driver's license for the candidate? Nope. An IDE or one or the other, but they're not obligated to drive, no. Okay. And you do background check? I don't ask anybody to drive. Drug screening. I see. You said $11 is the minimum, right? And what other benefits? Well, it's actually going to go up in September. Medicaid is going to take it all the way up to 13 in September. Seed season. Yeah. Medicaid is taking it up to 13 in September, but that's statewide. All states? All state Medicaid. Okay, got you. And regarding with the other benefits, you said none, just like if you only offer the hourly rate, right? No medical, dental, vision. right? Well, we offer, but it's not really good inserts. I'm going to lie to you. It's very crappy. Yeah. What about gift cards or bonus, luncheons, none of that? I'll do, I do bonuses every once in a while. Whenever, whenever, whenever we can get extra performance. No, it really, no, I'll give everybody a bonus. Everybody deserves to be happy. Yeah, I like it. Everybody will get. I'm sorry? You mean that it's a sign on bonus? Or that must be. No, no, no, no, no. I, for instance, if it's close to Christmas and I can get some incentive from my boss, then, you know, her and I will talk about it. It won't be a big bonus, but it will be something. Or on Christmas. I mean, it could be as low as $20. It could be as high as $50, $60. You know, just something in there, just thrown in there that other agencies don't do. Yeah, got you. And again, we do Google Meet, and then after that, you do the in-person interview, right? You do in-person or Facebook? You know what? I'm going to be real honest with you. If I get a client and I need a worker, I'm going to call every single one of them that's on my list. It's got a phone number, and I'm going to say, hey, is this near you? Are you interested? So you want to do phone calls only? No, I mean, I can do face-to-face. That's fine, too. But sometimes it's just, you know, I have a position open and I can't feel it because, I don't know, it's on that side of town. And all of my free workers are on this side of town. Well, they don't want to drive an hour to work. So I'm just going to put out an email or a phone call and say, start calling everybody that I have an application on. and I'm going to say, this is what I have open. Can you take it? Yes or no? I see. I'm going to go and meet them at the client's house. I'm going to meet them and I'll do the orientation with them about that specific client. Like that. And when are you planning to do an interview in person or Google Meet? Is it like you are open to interview a week from now, end of the month? Oh, I can interview any time they call me. I don't have a problem with that. So you're okay to interview candidates? They can call me. I don't want, like, 10 calls in one day, but, I mean, if somebody wants to call and say, hey, I'm interested, I can definitely take my time to see what type of town they are on, if they have a car, if they're willing to work mornings, nights. I'll do that immediately. I don't mind doing that immediately. I see, I see. I'm just making sure because our matching team will be happy to find a caregiver and we can set them proper expectations. So should I put a tentative, say, Friday or Monday next week? Which of the two? No, let's do Tuesdays. Let's try not to do any Mondays or any Fridays. Yeah, I know it's just busy. It's kind of hectic. Tuesday morning, around what time? 9.15. 9 to 10? AM or 9.15? Yeah, that works. 9 to 10 AM. 9 to 10 AM. Gotcha. And lastly, because I'll be needing your content for this, as part of our caregiver recruitment and placement services, Hirey may use automated systems, including AI-powered tools, to reach out to your business with updates regarding caregiver availability, job matching features, and related services in the future. This may include calls, texts, or emails. Do you want to send me to send you updates for the caregiver? Yes or no? Oh, you can send me emails. As long as my boss, I'm paying for it. Yep. Yes. I'm getting it. Yes. Right. And then, yeah. Yes. Thank you. I hear it. Yes.

So what do you specifically provide? I'm sorry, go ahead. What do you provide? Do you provide referrals? Or what do you provide? We provide referrals to caregivers and home health aid. Okay. Yeah. Okay, perfect. When you do the work or placement for your caregivers, is it normally for part-time or full-time? What do you think What do you think You understand the caregiver this way So what do you charge for it Okay for the subsequent hire the free caregiver will be for the first hire the second and succeeding. That will only cost you $99. However, we have another ongoing promo for this month of August. wherein you can... Who pays the $99? The agency or the caregiver? Okay. Per hire, it will cost you like only $99. It's not monthly. It's a one-time fee. So who pays the one-time fee of $99? Is it the caregiver or the agency? The agency. Okay. Or depends on how you you agree to it, but mostly it's the agency owner. Okay. All right. We'll think about it then. Yeah we have like another ongoing promo right now We can extend your free trial for the entire month of August The only thing you need is a refer a business or another company whom you know who are also looking for candidates.
