    "transcription": " Hello. Hey, how are you? I'm doing great. I received a missed call from you. Am I speaking with Oscar right now? Yes, this is Oscar. Hi, Oscar. My account manager. And then they transferred me to someone else. What's the name of the other person? Originally, though, your account manager was Mark. And then since Mark is no longer part of the company, because of the organizational change. That's the reason why I have reached out to you way back last week, letting you know or informing you that I am going to be your account manager moving forward. Yes. And then someone else will call me. Let me know her name so you make some notes because it's very important. Sure. Go ahead. Yeah, make a note. I speak with Lorraine. Oh, yeah. Lorraine, yeah, she's actually my colleague right now. Mistakenly, she actually have called you thinking that you were supposed to be assigned to her under her bucket, but we were able to figure out everything that she should not be able to reach you out in the first place because it just so happened that because of the organizational changes, all of the list of the clients were mixed up. So by mistake, she was able to reach you out and was able to introduce as your new account manager. But everything was actually fixed here in our end. Lorraine is not going to be your account manager. It's an honest mistake. So we do apologize for the confusion, but moving forward, I am going to be the only account manager who will be helping you out in your account moving forward, Oscar. Yes, yes. I speak to her last week. Okay. Yes. And I explained to her my situation that I'm on the budget right now. There's not enough income on my side and I have a lot of expenses. so I explained my situation to put a hold on my account please do not charge anything this month and she took a note of it also on the 6th sent an email to customer service explaining my situation also not to charge anything and today they charged me $900 which that made my account negative so I'm in a big trouble position right now. I'm so sorry to hear that from you. If I am not mistaken, prior on the organizational changes, your previous account manager named Mark was actually, if I'm not mistaken, based on the documentation, because each of every client, we have at least some notes on your account before they actually have transferred to like, you know, on the different paths or career wherever they actually have transferred right now. But based on what I have here on the documentations of Mark, he actually specifically indicated here on the notes as well that you were able to, or he was able to speak with you and offer you like an upgrade of your plan and everything went well for that. So the moment that you actually have agreed in upgrading your service into the $999 plan, he actually did already submitted an initial request directly to our billing team. So instead of your owed amount of the subscription for $499, it was actually put or set into an auto charge for $999. I believe that you were also able to let me know that you're actually on a financial feasibility way back last week. And I was able to also partner that directly with our billing team I did submit a request However it just so happened that Mark initially had settled or the billing team was actually able to process the first request that Mark did process the moment that you were able to agree with the upgrade prior of him leaving the company. So then when I actually have submitted a request for the pause, I believe that it's actually still on, you know, pending or on cue. That's why the billing team was not able to notice that right away up until you have called me right now to confirm that the charge has already been reflected into your account. So what I'll be doing here from my end is that I can go ahead and make a follow up directly to the billing team. If there's a way that we can go ahead and try to somehow reimburse if that's what you are trying to do. But let me set your proper expectation, Oscar. that right now, since the amount has already been reflected into your account, I cannot really 100% guarantee you that that's possible, but I will go ahead and try to let them know that you're actually on this current situation right now. As a matter of fact, you've already informed me last week, I'll try my best as your new account manager to deal with the billing team and what we can do. And then once I hear directly from the billing team, and I'll be more than willing to call you back this coming Monday if they have already responded. Since when we actually have talked, I believe the last time that we were able to speak was way back, hang on, let me, the 9th of, yeah, it's actually last week Friday as well. So that's the time that I have also sent directly a request to our billing team with you requesting for us to pause your account temporarily, right? That's your initial request. But as I have mentioned, prior of me taking over your account, it was Mark, that's your previous account manager, whom you were able to talk about the proposal for the upgrade plan of $999. So when I submitted a request to pause your account, since Mark was already able to initially send the request for your account to set for an upgrade for $999 for today, which is the 15th of August, that's technically what happened. So I just really wanted to let you know as well for transparency because we don't want to thank you that, we don't want you to think that even though that you have already requested us to post the account, we actually still continue in charging that. That's not what happened. The moment that we have spoke with last week, with your request, I did submit a notification from our billing team that you are requesting for your account to be paused. It just so happened that when I tried to partner it over with them, they have mentioned that when you were able to speak with Mark, When he did provide you or propose you the upgrade plan, right away he sent an email directly to the billing team to set the amount of $919,000 when the 15th will, you know, take place. And that's exactly what happened. So what I'll be doing right now, I'll go ahead and try to partner it over with our billing team. Today is Friday. I'll try to send them an email. I hope that they will be going to respond this coming Monday since the billing team is not operational during weekend. So probably within a week, they should be able to respond to me. And I will also note there to respond to me in a timely manner as I will need to give you an update as well in regards to this issue. Okay? So... But I want to let you know that I'm not happy now. I was happy on your service before, but now I'm not happy. I understand. It created big big damage on my side because I have a lot of debt right now So I don have any money to gas or food for a table this weekend you know I understand It very hard to run home I understand Well the little money that I have there is not no more there No more. It's kind of negative. I totally understand. Where are you coming from, Oscar? How I'm going to feed my family this weekend, you know. There's a big trouble. Yeah. I understand. I mean, it's not... Sorry. Let's talk. Now let me talk, okay? Let me express myself, take my anger out of it. So I already talked to my bank, and I reported and explained the situation, so I dispute this money. So you're going to let your team know that you're going to receive a complaint from me in my bank that that money is not supposed to be taken away because I have proved that I send an email with enough time through their question to not charge it. And somebody didn't need the job. Okay? It can be you. It can be the other assistant. Or it can be the accounting team. but someone didn't need the job that was requested, you know, in order to keep a satisfied customer. You know, I'm a business owner, so I know customers are very important, you know, and we're trying to retain customers and grow accounts, you know. And on my email, you know, I was very happy with your services. It just needs this month is very important for me, this month to get out of the debt that I have. And right now, you know, it did a big harm, you know, personal harm, you know, to me. Okay. So I want for you to pass this message that I'm telling you to your fire management. Sure. What happened is not acceptable. What happened is not acceptable as a business. You know, I should be screaming and be very aggressive, but I'm trying to control myself, you know, because it did a lot of damage for me. I understand. And that's exactly the reason why I'm actually letting you know about what happened. So, therefore, I will actually need to reach our billing team in regards. It's not acceptable because I talked to you and I talked to another manager, and then I sent my email with enough time for this not to happen, you know. So someone is not doing their job, and that's not a good service of the company. You know, that's not the way, you know, you're supposed to treat, you know, clients. They're not acceptable, you know. You know, this time, I'm not sure, you know, if I'm going to continue doing business, you know, with your company because damage is already done, and I already dispute it with my bank. then don't take no more charges from this company. So just talk to your management to see what they can do on your side to repair this damage. As mentioned, Dr. Iva, I'm actually listening. I'm letting you speak as well as what you requested. So yeah, as I have mentioned earlier, That's exactly what happened. And we sincerely apologize about what happened. I mean, if not because of like the notes that Mark left on your seat, I wouldn't be able to like understand what's really going on since I was just really also being assigned to you as your new account manager. So I really don't have the whole history about what's going on in your account. But with that note that was added directly into your sheet that's left by Mark, I was able to figure out what happened. And that really because of right after when you were able to talk about Mark about the upgrade and so on and he was able to set the date for the upgrade plan And that why he submitted as well directly a request to the billing team Why not you put any additional notes to cancel? You don't make any notes to cancel? That's exactly what I'm saying. Mark did actually have submitted the request prior of me sending the request to Poster account. So there's actually like a sequence, if you know what I mean. So the first email sent, that's the first one to be read out, right? So if Mark was able to send the request that the account should be charged for this amount on that particular date, then since you were able to speak with me just last week, then my email was actually still on the bottom. So there's a cue for our billing team to notice, especially if we would like to submit a request for like a cancellation. It's not that even Mark have already submitted a request and automatically the billing team will prioritize like cancellations or whatnot. They will actually need to follow whatever emails per date. So like the sorting of dates, depending on like the email. So that's exactly what happened. Last week, I did see you the 8th of August, and that's the time I have already submitted as well a notification to our billing team in regards to your request to post the account. It just so happened that Mark did initially, you know, submitted a request for your account to automatically be charged for that amount based on what you have talked about. Yeah, at this time, I want to make sure you put a note there that I want to cancel my service as well now. I'm not happy with the way they do in business. I totally understand. As mentioned, I will go ahead and follow it up with them. And then once I've already heard a response coming directly from our billing team, I'll make sure to reach back out to you. If not on Monday, within the next week, I should be able to hear from them. And then this is going to be, again, my direct phone number. You do not need to call Lorraine nor anyone else. I am your direct contact person. So if you have any questions or follow up, I can also send you a text message that, you know, hey, Oscar, the billing team is actually still in the process of like reviewing the request for, you know, the reimbursement or the dispute, if that's something that they can still possibly make. But again, I just really wanted to set your proper expectation that from here, it really depends on like the discretion of the billing team since they were able to see the request at a later time. but I'll make sure to give you an update from time to time once I've already received a response coming from them as well. Okay? All right. Yeah, I'll wait to respond for you on Monday, and if I don't answer the phone, you can leave messages, and I can respond to your callback. All right. Not a problem, Oscar. Again, we do apologize about what happened, but we will go ahead and try to figure out what we can do for you. we know that you've been with the company and with the platform and you were able to we were able to provide you service that made you satisfied and we also really wanted to keep business in you so we still wanted to look for ways on how we can settle everything up here. Alright? Okay, yeah, let's see what you can say from me Monday and then we'll talk. Alright. Well, thank you so much Oscar for taking the time to speak with me today and I really appreciate you taking my phone call and I appreciate you leaving me a voicemail. That way I was able to figure out what's really the issue all about because I was actually quite busy today. I'm on a back-to-back meeting, so I made sure to call you back right away with this quick break that I have, but that's totally fine. So long as we were able to exchange us thoughts right now and what's the reason why you were able to give us a call earlier, then I'm happy to give you an update as soon as our billing team will also be able to provide me a real-time update too. Okay? All right. Thank you. All right. You're welcome. Enjoy your weekend as well. You have a good one, Oscar. Bye-bye."

And on top of that, you can either choose to work full-time or part-time depending on your most available time. Is that something that you're interested with? Yes. Okay, I'll go ahead and perform a free screening process right now, Jasmine. So once we're all good with that, I'll be endorsing your information to the hiring manager so that they can call you for the initial interview over the phone okay Okay Okay By the way I would like to confirm if you have like a valid U working permit or you a U citizen Yes a U citizen Okay No criminal record or background? No. And you are fine passing the background check, right? Yes. Okay, thank you. May I know if how old are you right now? 29. Are you currently working or studying? No. I'm studying. Okay, thank you so much for confirming. And in case of you will be profiled to our life and health insurance license, are you willing to go through the licensing process once you're hired with the company? Yes. And may I know your current location or state? Georgia. Georgia. Hold on, let me just go ahead and check. Okay. I'll go ahead and send the details right now to the hiring manager so that they can contact you right away for a phone interview.

We train parents, people to become foster parents for the foster children in the state of Texas Oh so you don like hire any caregivers right like child caregivers So you only do a booster. You mean like a respite provider? Yes. Let's say if I have a foster child and the foster parent needs to go away for the weekend and I need to find someone to watch that foster child for the weekend, that's a respite provider? Is that what you're speaking of? Yes, that's right. Okay. Or are you asking if you can get the trainings to become a full-time foster parent with the foster children? And that means they'll stay in your home for six months to a year. Okay. Hello? Hello? Hello? Are you there?"

I just want to you know give or ask for a follow-up call here miss because you mentioned last time that you're looking for three cnas and we've sent you an email already about this miss uh that we help caregivers right now to get a job so they are available right now miss to conduct or if you can if you are available as well to conduct interviews we do have available candidates on file that can write that are ready to start as well we actually filled those positions so we won't be needing any more help how about hha and uncertified miss well that is what we hired is home health aides. I see. When do you think you will be hiring more people, Miss? Do you have estimated time or do you have available patient in the future, do you think? At the moment, I can't really say because home health is, you know, we have patients come on services and they leave services and it'll just depend on how our staffing looks. It hard to give you an outlook on that though Well I agree I agree to that Miss But is it okay Ms to at least save your information here so that once you look you are looking for caregivers at least you can just call me back right away and we provide you the candidates that based on your standards, because I know for sure, Ms. Sam, you have your own standards in hiring people, right? Yes. Yeah. So the only thing that we need to ask here, ma'am, for example, the number of years of experience and also what prefer of interviews we will you will come back is it like a zoom meeting or a Google meeting those are the questions that we needed so that once you have available one you need to want to contact us as well it's ready I mean we have already a candidate that is ready to do with the interview is it okay with you ma'am yeah it's more on like asking your standard ma'am in hiring candidates so that we can match made in the future once you hire candidates for example like whenever we have that come up i can call you and let you know everything but right now we're not needing help we're well staffed okay that's totally fine well i don't have any problems to it um i already sent you an email last time i'm the only thing that you need to do is to track it and then i just check hiring on it now so that you can reply once you are looking for someone okay okay thank you so much awesome thank you miss sam and have a great day and good rest of your day bye bye useful thank you bye"

Based on the conversation that you have with one of my people, I'd like to arrange an interview view between you and a recruiter in your area. Would you like to hear some details about it, perhaps? Sure. Wonderful. I do a big client right here who's looking for a non-certified caregiver. The location is in Magnolia, Texas, 77354. It's like a 21-minute drive away from you. The schedule for this is every weekend, part-time, Saturdays and Sundays, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and then the compensation is around $12.50 to $14. It varies on the experience and that's pretty negotiable depending on the experience you have. They are looking for someone who can start immediately and looking for someone who can provide personal care. Is that something that you might be interested, ma'am? When you say personal care, does that mean bathing and maybe putting a catheter and all that kind of stuff? Um, personal care, which means assisting them. Yeah, batting, medication, stuff like that. Um, well, more like companionship. Okay, well, that's really good. That sounds like something I'm going to be interested in. Um, however, um."

By the way, this is Ian from Hirees AI Job Search Assistant for Caregivers. The reason for this is to confirm some details about your interest in a caregiver in Houston. Am I speaking with the right person by any chance? Yeah. Yeah, this is Linda Porter. Yes, ma'am. Based on the conversation that you have with my people recently, which happens to be my May, I think that was earlier, I'd like to arrange an interview between you and a recruiter in your area. Would you like to hear some details about it, perhaps? Yeah, please. I do have a client right here who's looking for a non-certified caregiver. The location is in Magnolia, Texas 77354. It like a 15 drive away from you However the position only happens every weekend Saturdays and Sundays part 9 a to 9 p The compensation for this is around to per hour It varies on the experience, but that's pretty negotiable depending on the experience that you have. And they are looking for someone who can start immediately and someone who can provide personal Is this something that you might be interested in? So it's Saturday and Sunday, and what is the hours? 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., 12 hours. Yeah, I don't think I would want to do a 12-hour shift on the weekends, both days on the weekend. Yeah, I wouldn't be interested in that particular one. I'm sorry. You know, I totally don't understand, though. So if you do have other clients or was nearby on your area, we'll definitely contact you back, okay? Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you. Have a good day. Thank you so much. All right. Bye."
